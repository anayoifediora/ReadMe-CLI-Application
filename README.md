# Readme.md File generator 

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a Command-Line Application that automatically generates a README.md file based on given user inputs/responses to pre-defined prompts. As a web developer, a quality README file is a very signficant aspect of any project because it contains information about the project and requires some time and effort to write. Developing this application saves a lot of time and helps develop a README template that can be adopted for so many future projects.

Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of Node.js. I learnt how to use code libraries and also learnt new ECMAScript 6 syntax.

## Mock-up
